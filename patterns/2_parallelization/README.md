# Parallelization Example: Product Review Summarization

This example demonstrates the parallelization pattern using a product review summarization system.

## What is Parallelization?

Parallelization in GenAI applications involves processing multiple inputs simultaneously using multiple threads or processes. This can significantly reduce the overall processing time for large numbers of similar tasks.

## This Example

In this example, we parallelize the summarization of multiple product reviews:

1. Define a function to summarize a single review
2. Use ThreadPoolExecutor to process multiple reviews in parallel
3. Collect and display the results

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have set up your AWS credentials for Bedrock access.
2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the script:
python example.py


## Expected Output

The script will process multiple reviews in parallel, printing each review and its summary as they complete.

## Customization

You can modify the `reviews` list in the `example.py` file to test with different reviews or increase the number of reviews to see the benefits of parallelization more clearly.

## Note on Parallelization

While this example uses threading, the actual performance improvement may be limited by API rate limits or the specific GenAI model's capacity. In a production environment, you might need to implement more sophisticated parallelization techniques or queue systems to handle larger volumes efficiently.
